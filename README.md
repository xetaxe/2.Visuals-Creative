# Visuals-Creative

The aim of this repo is to agglutinate some side mini-projects I have coded over time. They are more centered on the creative and visual side of web programming. These range from cool/unconventional ways of working with HTML and CSS, mini-games, WebGL, and more!

Unless specified, none of them makes use of external libraries or dependencies, nor build tools. This makes the code very readable and replicable, and ideal for programmers who just started working with some of these concepts.

Do not doubt to suggest new ideas, if they are interesting! I might work on them if I have time :)
